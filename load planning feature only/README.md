## 🎯 What This Feature Does

The Load Planning feature allows users to:

1. **Input load specifications**: Origin, destination, dimensions (feet/inches), weight, overhang
2. **Select custom route**: Choose states the load will travel through
3. **Calculate escort requirements**: Based on state-specific regulations for oversized loads
4. **View results**: State-by-state breakdown of escort requirements, route surveys, police escorts
5. **Interactive map**: Google Maps integration showing route visualization
6. **Share & print**: Generate shareable results and print-friendly reports
7. **Report issues**: Feedback system for regulation corrections

## 🔧 Core Technologies

- **Backend**: Python Flask with Jinja2 templating
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **APIs**: Google Maps (Places, Directions, Geocoding)
- **Database**: State regulations stored in JavaScript file (no database required)
- **Email**: Flask-Mail for feedback reports

## ⚡ Key Features

### Frontend Capabilities
- **Real-time validation** with user-friendly error messages
- **Smart dimension inputs** with automatic feet/inches conversion
- **State autocomplete** with tag-based selection
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Print-optimized styling** for professional reports
